This is the Twitch.tv project for [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org).

The app fulfills the following user stories:

* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

* If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
